# **GitHub Setup Instructions for Teams, Co-Pilot, and Power Automate**

## **📌 Project Overview**
This project automates document processing by integrating **Microsoft Teams, Co-Pilot, and Power Automate**. Users can upload **text and PDF files**, which are then processed using AI-driven workflows to extract, analyze, and store data securely.

## **📂 Features**
✔️ **Seamless File Upload** – Users can upload documents via Teams or Power Automate triggers.  
✔️ **Intelligent Processing** – Extracts text from PDFs and text files using AI (OCR, NLP).  
✔️ **Automated Workflows** – Stores extracted data in SharePoint, Dataverse, or OneDrive.  
✔️ **Co-Pilot Integration** – Enables querying, summarization, and insights from uploaded documents.  
✔️ **Secure & Scalable** – Implements **Azure security best practices** for data protection.
